# HyperChain - A prototype for a Private Blockchain in PoA Consensus

This repository is a simple instruction for future developers on the systems built for this project.

## Introduction

The LAF3-BD project is a system developed for processing audios of students learning how to speak in Brazil.
The Brazilian Government expressed its concerns over the current fluency of 1st Grade Students over certain words of the Portuguese Language.

The whole scope of the project is to utilize different Information Technologies to process audio sent by students by different means, such as:

- Artificial Inteligence algorithms for fluency parameters;
- Non-Relational and Relational Databases ;
- An IBFT 2.O Blockchain for resilient storage of specific databits.

In this repository, the latter will be the focus of development.

## Technology

The preferred framework of choice is Hyperledger Besu, as it is an Ethereum Client framework, capable of developing Private Blockchains in a Proof of Authority consensus mechanism.
